> Spec: Cloudflare Turnstile Integration
> Created: 2025-09-03
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Integrate Cloudflare Turnstile CAPTCHA protection into HuCommerce to protect WooCommerce checkout and my account forms from bot attacks while maintaining user experience.

## User Stories

- As a store owner, I want to protect my WooCommerce checkout and login forms from bot attacks using Cloudflare Turnstile to reduce spam and fraudulent submissions
- As a customer, I want a seamless, privacy-friendly CAPTCHA experience that doesn't interrupt my shopping or account access process
- As a store administrator, I want to easily configure Turnstile settings (theme, size) through the HuCommerce admin interface without technical complexity

## Spec Scope

1. Add Cloudflare Turnstile widget to WooCommerce checkout form and my account login/registration forms
2. Block form submission when Turnstile validation fails with appropriate error messages
3. Provide admin settings for Turnstile configuration (Site Key, Secret Key, theme selection, size selection)
4. Store API keys securely using WordPress hashing standards in database
5. Implement graceful fallback when Turnstile service is unavailable (allow form submission with warning)

## Out of Scope

- Pro-only functionality (this is a free module)
- Turnstile integration on other forms (contact, comments, etc.)
- Custom logging or analytics of Turnstile attempts
- Custom error message customization (use default Cloudflare messages)
- Advanced Turnstile configuration options beyond theme and size

## Expected Deliverable

- Turnstile widgets appear and function correctly on checkout and my account forms in a live WordPress/WooCommerce environment
- Form submissions are blocked when Turnstile validation fails, with users receiving clear error feedback
- Admin can configure Turnstile settings through HuCommerce admin panel, with changes taking effect immediately on frontend forms
