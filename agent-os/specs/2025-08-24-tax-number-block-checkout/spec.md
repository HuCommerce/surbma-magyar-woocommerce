> Spec: Tax Number Block Checkout Compatibility
> Created: 2025-08-24
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement WooCommerce block checkout compatibility for the existing tax number field functionality. This will allow Hungarian WooCommerce stores to use the tax number field with modern block-based checkout while maintaining backward compatibility with shortcode checkout.

## User Stories

### Store Administrator Story
**As a** Hungarian WooCommerce store administrator  
**I want** to enable the tax number field on both shortcode and block checkouts  
**So that** I can provide a consistent tax number collection experience regardless of which checkout type my customers use

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Administrator accesses HuCommerce plugin settings in WordPress admin
2. Enables the "Tax Number Field" module in the plugin configuration
3. Configures tax number field settings (required/optional, validation rules)
4. The field appears automatically on both shortcode and block checkout pages
5. Tax number data is collected and stored with orders using either checkout type

### Customer Story
**As a** Hungarian business customer  
**I want** to enter my tax number during checkout on any checkout page type  
**So that** I can receive proper tax invoices for my business purchases

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Customer adds products to cart and proceeds to checkout
2. Customer sees tax number field in billing section (regardless of checkout type)
3. Customer enters their Hungarian tax number (11 digits)
4. Field validates the tax number format in real-time
5. Tax number is saved with the order and appears on invoices and order details

### Developer/Maintainer Story
**As a** plugin developer/maintainer  
**I want** the tax number field to work seamlessly with WooCommerce blocks  
**So that** the plugin remains compatible with modern WooCommerce installations and future updates

**Detailed Workflow:**
1. Developer implements block checkout integration using WooCommerce's official APIs
2. Tax number field registers with the checkout block using proper extension points
3. Field validation and processing works identically between shortcode and block checkouts
4. Existing functionality remains unchanged for shortcode checkout users
5. Plugin automatically detects checkout type and applies appropriate integration

## Spec Scope

1. Implement WooCommerce Checkout Block extension integration for the tax number field using official WooCommerce block APIs
2. Register tax number field with the checkout block's billing field collection system
3. Apply existing tax number validation rules (Hungarian tax number format) to block checkout submissions
4. Ensure tax number data is properly saved to order meta and displayed in admin order details for block checkout orders
5. Maintain full backward compatibility with existing shortcode checkout functionality and settings

## Out of Scope

- Modification of existing shortcode checkout functionality or validation logic
- Changes to tax number field display in admin areas, order emails, or invoices
- Implementation of new tax number validation rules or formats beyond existing Hungarian format
- Integration with other checkout blocks beyond the core WooCommerce checkout block
- Migration tools or conversion utilities between checkout types

## Expected Deliverable

1. **Block Checkout Field Display**: Tax number field appears correctly in the billing section of WooCommerce block checkout pages with identical styling and behavior to shortcode checkout
2. **Field Validation**: Real-time validation of Hungarian tax number format (11 digits) functions identically on both shortcode and block checkout pages
3. **Order Data Storage**: Tax numbers entered through block checkout are properly saved to order meta and displayed in WordPress admin order details, matching the data structure used by shortcode checkout
